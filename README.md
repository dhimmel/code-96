The [`v`](v) directory contains directories for each manuscript version.
In general, a version is identified by the commit hash of the source content that created it.
The `*.ots` files in version directories are OpenTimestamps which can be used to verify manuscript existence at or before a given time.
[OpenTimestamps](opentimestamps.org) uses the Bitcoin blockchain to attest to file hash existence.
